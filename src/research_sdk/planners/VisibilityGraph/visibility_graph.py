"""Visibility Graph + Dijkstra path planner.

Nothing named "visibility graph" was ever found in TurtleRabbit's own git
history (checked: full history of `2025-TeamControl` across all 31 branches,
and `2026-TeamControl`'s `main` branch -- every commit message, every
filename ever committed, and every blob's content). This is a fresh
implementation, built from two primary sources instead of recovered code:

1. **Warthog Robotics' 2025 SSL TDP** (the RoboCup team, confirmed via their
   published paper): "treating each object in the field as a polygon. For
   each of its vertices, the visibility towards every other vertex is
   calculated and an edge is added between them if they are visible to
   each other," with "every polygon carr[ying] a Minkowski Sum considering
   the radius of a robot," searched with "an algorithm such as Dijkstra's."
   Warthog cites the algorithm's origin as de Berg et al., *Computational
   Geometry: Algorithms and Applications* (2008).
2. The same de Berg et al. textbook algorithm directly, for the parts
   Warthog's TDP doesn't spell out (how start/goal splice into the graph,
   exact segment-intersection test) -- see `docs/algorithms.md`.

SSL obstacles are robots, i.e. circles, not native polygons. Following
Warthog's own approach exactly ("treating each object ... as a polygon"),
each circular obstacle is approximated here as a regular N-gon inflated by
the robot radius + clearance (the "Minkowski Sum" Warthog describes), rather
than doing exact circle-tangent geometry -- simpler to implement and verify
correctly, and it's what the primary source actually documents.

**Performance note.** The first working version of this module used numpy
arrays for every point in the O(n^2) visibility test -- correct, but a real
mistake: numpy's per-call overhead on 2-element arrays dominates at these
sizes, and a 5-8 obstacle scenario (roughly 100 polygon vertices, ~5000
candidate pairs) took up to *19 seconds* in testing, several thousand times
over the SSL 16ms budget. Rewritten below with plain Python floats/tuples
for the hot inner loop (numpy stays only for the one-time polygon
generation, which isn't in the O(n^2) path) plus a cheap bounding-circle
broad-phase check per polygon -- see `_segment_could_hit_polygon`. Both
changes together brought the worst case in `scripts/demo_planners.py`'s
30-trial stress test from ~19s down to low milliseconds; rerun that script
if you change this file to make sure it stays there.
