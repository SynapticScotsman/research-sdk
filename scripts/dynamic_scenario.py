"""Replicate da Silva Costa & Tonidandel's dynamic replanning test, offline.

Their JIRS 2021 paper (docs/papers/dasilvacosta-tonidandel-2021-...) evaluates
planners in a "dynamic perspective": the robot's start and goal sit on a
horizontal line from the centre circle to the goal area (their Figs 15-16, the
red line), and 7 or 5 obstacles run on fixed rectangular loops that cross that
line. One sample = the robot leaves start and reaches goal. They report:

  accumulated computational time   sum of every planning call until arrival, ms
  paths recalculated               times the path was invalid and replanned
  navigation time                  start to goal, s
  number of collisions             contacts with any obstacle

Their replan trigger, reproduced exactly: a path is invalid when any obstacle
comes within 90 mm (the robot radius) of it. Their own words on its weakness
are the gap this work exists to fill -- "even though a new path would only need
a minor change in the invalid path, the whole algorithm needs to run again."

Their benchmark to beat (Table 9, scenario 1): DVG+A* 13.09 recalculations
mean, RRT 34.08.

## What is scaled and what is not

Their field is 12 x 9 m (Division A at the time); ours is 9 x 6 m Division B,
so the loop geometry is scaled by 0.75 in x and 0.667 in y. Robot radius (90 mm)
and the 90 mm trigger are physical and are NOT scaled. They do not state the
obstacle speed; it is a parameter here, defaulted to 1.0 m/s, and every result
prints it.

## Why offline

Everything the metric needs -- obstacle poses, the robot's progress along its
path, contact -- is kinematic. Running it in grSim would add physics noise
without adding information, and would cost minutes per sample instead of
milliseconds. grSim is for the closed-loop tier where control error matters.

Usage:
    python scripts/dynamic_scenario.py                # both scenarios, 3 planners
    python scripts/dynamic_scenario.py --samples 50 --obstacle-speed 1.5
    python scripts/dynamic_scenario.py --plot scenario.png   # their Fig 15, ours
    python scripts/dynamic_scenario.py --selftest
